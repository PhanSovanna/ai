    Jo WithME helps the Facebook User to automatically reply the messages when they have no spare time to respond.
    The chatbot that we're currently developing focuses on the concept of a personal message.
    Ever since the start of development, our main focus of building the chatbot is to provide the user with the enrich experience of
having a conversation more human-like. We has shaped the chatbot to be what the sender wants when talking to a real person.
    While the bot is currently in a developing phase, the data and conversation we've built are in the category of personal comfort. In other words,
you can chat to the bot if you feel like you need somebody to talk to. Thanks to the smart technology of Dialogflow that's linked to
our chatbot, we can have a conversation with bot that feels more realistic.
    In the near future, if our team has a vision of building a real virtual assistance if we can succeed on this project or we can also
continue to built chatbot that can work in real business, like in hotel reservation, restaurant booking or school information center.


***To use the chatbot, please put your email and password of your facebook account as the parameters in the main function of our Python code.
